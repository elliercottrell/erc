          I am a drawer based in Cheltenham. Although doing an Art Foundation in
          2008 I went on to study graphic design and didn't return to a drawing
          practice until a short time ago.

          Since then I have continued to move through different mediums,
          currently working in oil pastel on paper exploring the figure and
          natural forms. My journey into this new practice is at its beginning
          and I feel in an experimental stage as I grow and learn with each
          piece. Through the current work I play with themes of human
          interaction, its necessary vulnerabilities and representation of
          thoughts, repeatedly through the interference of nature. Drawn from
          owned photographs or modified found imagery; often rather than a
          portrait, figures and their interaction with their surroundings mean
          to convey a feeling or idea.

          This ongoing collection explores ideas of the inside of <i>our</i>{" "}
          minds. They aim to express how we interact with our own anxieties and
          countervailing feelings of constraint and support, overwhelm and
          creation. Although they aim to be "beautiful" they can also incite a
          sense of unease and tension.{" "}
